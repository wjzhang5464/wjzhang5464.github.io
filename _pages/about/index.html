I focus on probabilistic modeling, compression, and reconstruction for <strong>single-photon LiDAR</strong> systems. Currently, I am developing forward models and inverse algorithms that account for <strong>hardware dead time</strong> and other high-flux nonlinear effects.</p> <p><strong>Previously.</strong> I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the <a href="https://www.ee.ucla.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</a> and my B.Eng. in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering from the <a href="https://sose.uestc.edu.cn/en/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)</a>. At UESTC, I worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vr4K5noAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Zhao Wang</a> on optical coherence tomography (OCT) system development.</p> <p><strong>Outside research.</strong> I enjoy playing basketball 🏀, weight lifting 🏋️‍♂️, and—more recently—running 🏃‍♂️!</p> </body></html>
